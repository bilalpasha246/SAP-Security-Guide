You can assign projects or project views of the Implementation Guide (IMG) to a _Customizing role_. The purpose of such an assignment is to specifically generate the authorization for certain IMG activities and assign it to users.

If you are on the _Menu_ tab page in the Role Maintenance transaction, you can assign projects or view from the Implementation Guide (IMG) by choosing _Utilities_ → _Customizing Auth_. When the profile is generated, the system creates the authorization, which is necessary to perform all activities of the IMG projects/project views assigned.
