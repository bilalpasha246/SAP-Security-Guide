Objective

After completing this lesson, you will be able to understand the Classical and SAP Fiori Authorization Models.
Classical Authorization Model
Illustration on Classical Authorization Model without SAP Fiori.
Typical SAP GUI transactions are called using the role menu. On the back-end server, the ABAP program behind the transaction code is defined in transaction SE93.

After you have added the transaction code to the role menu in the PFCG role, the role will contain the start authorization and data access authorization.

SAP Fiori Content Model
SAP Fiori App
Technically, apps are represented by the following:

KPI tiles to launch the app.
App launcher tiles to launch the app.
Target mappings referencing the actual navigation targets.
Illustration on titles and target mapping for SAP Fiori App.
Tiles and Target Mapping
Tiles represent the visual part of a tile such as a title, subtitle, information, icon and the semantic object and action for the intent-based navigation.

Target mappings define the target application which is launched when an intent (semantic object/action) is triggered.

Target mapping is part of the SAP Fiori launchpad configuration. It defines the target application, which is launched when clicking on a tile, on a link, or within an app-to-app navigation.

SAP Fiori Content Model - SAP S/4HANA
The apps that are displayed to the users are organized using the following SAP Fiori launchpad content:

Catalog
A catalog is a set of apps that you want to make available for your users to authorize them to work with the apps. The users can browse through the catalog, choose apps from the catalog, and add them to the home page of their SAP Fiori launchpad.

SAP delivers technical catalogs which contain apps per application area. In addition, SAP delivers business catalogs as sample collection of apps relevant for a business role. You can also create you own custom business catalogs. You can use the SAP Fiori launchpad content manager or the SAP Fiori launchpad designer.

Technical catalogs (TC) provide tiles and target mappings cut by solution area, but not by technology. In technical catalog, legacy apps as well as SAPUI5 Fiori apps are available.

Business catalogs (BC) reference tiles and target mappings of technical catalogs (TC) according to segregation of duty. A business catalog can reference tiles and target mappings from one or several technical catalogs.

Group
The SAP Fiori launchpad home page is the central part of the launchpad, which structures the SAP Fiori launchpad content. Here, users access all applications relevant to their business case. The apps can be SAP Fiori app or classic applications. Business catalog groups (BCG) define the SAP Fiori launchpad home page. The apps in the group are a subset of apps that are referenced from one or several catalogs. The tiles which are displayed on a user’s home page are dependent on the catalogs and groups that are assigned to the user’s roles. If a group contains apps that are not assigned to the user via catalogs, the app is not displayed on the user’s home page. In addition, if configured, the user can personalize the home page by adding or removing apps to predelivered groups or self-defined group.

SAP also delivers business catalog groups as sample collection of apps relevant for a business role. You can also create your own custom groups. You can maintain these entities using the SAP Fiori launchpad designer.

From SAP S/4HANA 2021, groups mode is officially deprecated, meaning that while groups currently still exist, they will be removed in a future release.

For details on migrating from groups to spaces and pages see SAP Note 3322675 - Guidelines on Migrating from Groups to Spaces and Pages

Space and Pages
Spaces and pages represent an alternative option to structure the layout of the home page of SAP Fiori launchpad compared to the group-based home page. A space is the unit that holds one or more pages. It is assigned to the user based on the work profile (user role). Users may see several spaces on their launchpad home page. The spaces are displayed in the navigation bar and if more than one page is available, a drop down appears under the corresponding space and the user can navigate to a given page. If there is only one page in a space, when clicking on the space, user gets directly to that page.

Spaces and pages are maintained in the Manage Launchpad Spaces Fiori app and the Manage Launchpad Pages Fiori app.

PFCG Roles
Business roles (BR) combine multiple business catalogs (BC) and business catalog groups (BCG) and/or Spaces.

By adding the catalogs to the role menu, the user gets access to the apps included in the catalog. By adding spaces or groups, you define the SAP Fiori launchpad home page.

In the following, you will find an overview of naming conventions and short definitions.

Element	Short	Naming Schema	Description
Business Role	BR	Z_BR_	Role for topic
Space	SP	Z_SP_	Tiles based on the work profile
Page	 	Z_PG_	Tiles based duties in work profile
Business Catalog Group	BCG	Z_BCG_	Describe contents of group
Business Catalog	BC	Z_BC_	Tiles for duty
Technical Catalog	TC	Z_TC_	Tiles for area
Business catalogs (BC) reference tiles and target mappings of technical catalogs (TC) according to segregation of duty. Business catalog groups (BCG) now contain apps from various business catalogs (BC), making a subtopic. Business roles (BR) replace business catalog roles (BCR), combining multiple business catalogs (BC) and business catalog groups (BCG) in one topic.

In this example from the SAP Fiori app reference library, you see content model elements under Technical Configuration, starting with TC and continuing with BC, BCG, and BR. BC and BCR have the name of the topic in common, whereas the BR contains the end user role name.

Screenshot of the Content Model Example.
SAP Fiori Authorization Model
SAP Fiori apps adopt the user management and authorization concepts provided by ABAP Platform (Application Server ABAP).

The security recommendations and guidelines for user and role administration and authorization as described in the SAP NetWeaver ABAP Platform Security Guide also apply for the SAP Fiori apps.

To use SAP Fiori apps, users need app-specific SAP Fiori user interface (UI) entities and authorizations. You use PFCG roles to assign these types of entities to users.

SAP Fiori launchpad is the access point to apps on mobile or desktop devices. To use SAP Fiori apps, users need the following app-specific types of entities:

UI:
The SAP Fiori UI entities that define which SAP Fiori apps are displayed to the user. The apps are organized through catalogs and spaces and pages.

Authorizations:
The authorizations that are required to use SAP Fiori launchpad, to start SAP Fiori apps, and to use the business logic and data of the apps.

To see the tile, launch the SAP Fiori app, and get business data from the OData service, a specific OData authorization is necessary. This is provided through a PFCG role that contains a catalog and a space.

Note

Please be aware, that the standard scenario in this training is the embedded front-end server (FES) deployment option. In this scenario, only one PFCG role is required in the SAP S/4HANA system as back-end server.

For the stand-alone FES deployment option, a PFCG front-end server and a back-end server roles are necessary. PFCG front-end server role with the catalog and group needs the OData start authorization to call the back-end server (BES). The PFCG back-end server role contains the execute and access authorization of the OData service.

However, this is not subject of this training.

PFCG Roles
Illustration on the SAP Fiori Authorization Concept.
You use PFCG roles to assign the UI entities and authorizations to the users:

PFCG roles
To get the authorizations for Fiori Apps, you add the OData services to the PFCG role menu. By adding the catalogs to the role menu, you include the apps in the catalog that is available to the users. The system determines the OData services for a catalog and automatically includes the authorizations.

Hint

If available, we recommend adding the catalog to the role menu to automatically determine the OData services that are included in the catalog. With that, you can organize the update of authorizations when the catalog changes.
The OData services that the SAP Fiori apps use are implemented in the SAP S/4HANA system. The users need to have start authorizations for the OData services’ data provider and start authorizations for the model provider of the activated OData services (embedded FES functionality). Also, users needs all the business authorizations for accessing the business data that is displayed in the app.

For object pages, the authorization defaults also include the authorizations for the SAP Fiori search connectors. The OData services carry the authorization defaults for the business authorizations as suggested by SAP. This adds the start authorizations and the authorization defaults for the business authorizations of the applications to the role.

In case of legacy apps, you can add the transaction code or the WebDynpro application to the PFCG role menu. This adds the start authorizations and the authorization defaults for the business authorizations of the applications to the role. However, legacy apps are also included in the Fiori catalog, so it is more efficient to add a catalog to the role menu. The system automatically determines the authorizations objects to be checked.

By adding spaces to the role menu, you define the SAP Fiori launchpad home page.

Sequence When Starting an SAP Fiori App
When the user starts the SAP Fiori launchpad, the launchpad displays the app tiles that are assigned to users via catalogs and organized in spaces and pages.

A launchpad-specific OData service resolves the catalogs and spaces a user is assigned to: This service resolves the user’s catalog and space assignments using the PFCG roles the user belongs to on front-end server (FES), by collecting the corresponding catalog and space entries in the PFCG role menu.

To start an SAP Fiori app, the user chooses a tile. The tile resolves the technical SAP Fiori app implementation to be started using a target mapping.

When a user’s browser loads an SAP Fiori app, the app retrieves its dynamic data from the HTTP endpoint of the app-specific OData service on the FES. SAP Gateway translates the HTTP request to a trusted RFC call to the SAP Gateway enablement of the BES, which then retrieves the data by calling the relevant business logic.

The user requires authorizations for the app-specific OData service, that is, the start authorizations for the service and the business authorizations required by the business logic.

In the case of legacy apps, where the tile with its target mapping points to a SAP GUI transaction or a WebDynpro application, the SAP Fiori launchpad calls the application in the back-end server system directly without using an OData service.

Authorization Proposals for OData Services
Illustration on Authorization Proposals.
When adding a catalog to a PFCG role, the start authorizations for the implemented and activated OData services for the catalog are included in the role menu as sub-nodes below the catalog entry.

The behavior of the role maintenance (PFCG) and the authorization checks that are to be performed are defined by authorization proposals which can be maintained in transaction SU24 (Maintain Authorization Default Values). Among other application types, SU24 defines the authorization proposal values for transactions, WebDynpro applications, and OData Services.

Illustration on the Authorization Maintenance for SAPUI5 Fiori Apps UI and Data Access.
When you add a catalog to a PFCG role, make sure to choose the Include Applications check box. The start authorizations for the activated OData services and start authorizations for the OData service data providers are then included in the role menu as sub-nodes below the catalog entry. In addition, the authorization defaults delivered by SAP for these services and applications are added to the role.

In both, SU24 and PFCG, you will find the object types of the activated OData services and OData services data providers since they are TADIR objects. Activated OData services have the object type IWSG – Gateway: Service Groups Metadata. The implemented OData services as data providers have the type SAP Gateway Business Suite Enablement - Service. In a system with the embedded FES, both object types will appear in a single PFCG role.

Authorization Values in Role Maintenance
Authorization default values for non-transactional services are stored using a hash code-based key entry. You can see the hash code, for example, as a technical name in the SU24 when displaying the authorization defaults.

Screenshot showing the Technical Name field for the OData Service.
On the Authorizations tab of the role maintenance the hash code-based key entry is shown too. The original application name can be shown by displaying the Define Values window.

Screenshot on the Authorization Values in PFCG.
The connection between the hash code-based key entry and the original application name is saved in the table USOBHASH. The content of this table is the basis for the input help and existence validation of these applications.
