It is vital to optimally administer key system **configurations** to keep systems secure and robust. As important, you must **monitor** the systems to safeguard against potential changes that could cause a threat.

Both services ultimately aim to improve an SAP system's overall performance, stability, and security, albeit with a specific focus on different aspects of the system.

To improve the overall performance, stability, and security of an SAP System, SAP provides several services:

1. SAP EarlyWatch Alert (EWA)
2. SAP Security Optimization Services
3. SAP Code Vulnerability Analyzer (CVA)


SAP EarlyWatch Alert is an automatic service that analyzes the essential administrative areas of an SAP system and alerts the administrator about any potential issues—whether it is an On-Premise system or an SAP Cloud Solution. Alerts indicate critical situations and provide solutions to improve performance and stability. SAP EWA enables you to uncover missing security configurations, making it possible to identify standard problems before they become acute.

SAP EarlyWatch Alert is most effective for all SAP components running On-Premise systems or private or public cloud services. It gives a weekly overview of KPIs and alerts.

The EarlyWatch report also analyzes system security issues in terms of authorization and, therefore, covers the following topics:

- SAP Security Notes about ABAP and Kernel Software Corrections
- Default Passwords of Standard Users
- Password Policy
- Gateway and Message Server Security
- Users with Critical Authorizations

You can view these alerts by accessing your SAP Solution Manager and, from there, the EarlyWatch Alert report. This report provides information like system performance, configuration settings, hardware capacity, and so on. It uses meters and tables to highlight system performance and potential issues that need attention. If there are issues, a red mark is shown next to the problematic component. The green mark means that everything is working correctly.![[Pasted image 20251008101034.png]]

Use the SAP EarlyWatch Alert Workspace for convenient access to SAP EarlyWatch Alert information. This cloud service is available as an application tile in SAP for Me. The central landing page comprehensively overviews your system landscape regarding stability, configuration, hardware utilization, and performance.

Security optimization service focuses on identifying and addressing potential security vulnerabilities within the SAP system. By acting proactively, the service ensures the smooth operation of your system. This includes conducting security assessments, implementing security best practices, and providing recommendations for improving the overall security posture of the system.

Keeping the security and availability of your SAP solution high is a tremendous value to an organization. The SOS analysis will:

- Decrease the risk of a system intrusion
- Ensure the confidentiality of business data
- Ensure the authenticity of the system users
- Substantially reduce the risk of costly downtime due to wrong user interaction

The SAP CVA scans companies' custom code during the development process and is tightly integrated with the ABAP Development Workbench toolset and the ABAP Test Cockpit (ATC). Analysis scans are designed to detect security flaws and dumps to make custom code secure before deployment. Integration with standard ABAP development and change management tools allows developers easy access to testing functionality and extensive documentation to resolve identified or potential coding issues.

SAP CVA ensures that development and quality assurance teams have access to the technical capabilities to:

- Automatically detect weaknesses in your ABAP source code.
- Reduce false-positive rate through data flow analysis.
- Support exemption workflows to ease the handling of false positives.
- Integration into standard ABAP development infrastructure (ABAP Test Cockpit).
- Support for single object and group object testing.
- Capture manual and automated check executions.
- Access extensive documentation to avoid and remediate issues in custom code.![[Pasted image 20251008102904.png]]
