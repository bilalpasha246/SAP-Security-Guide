Identity Provisioning is designed to provide customers with easy identity and access management for cloud-based solutions. As with the Identity Authentication service, the Identity Provisioning service can be used with SAP Identity Management to extend Compliant Identity Management to cloud-based systems or deployed as part of SAP Identity and Access Management as a service. The service automates those processes and helps you provision identities and related authorizations to various cloud and on-premises business applications.![[Pasted image 20251007142637.png]]

The Identity Provisioning solution allows you to do the following:
- Manage user accounts and authorizations across Cloud and On-Premise systems
- Provision identities from user stores in the Cloud and On-Premise
- Centralized end-to-end life cycle management of corporate identities
- Fast and efficient administration of user onboarding
- Enable business applications to support Single Sign-On with Identity Authentication quickly

As a Key Value Proposition, the solution provides the following:
- Rapid scenario extensions using optimized connectors for provisioning users and groups among multiple supported SAP and non SAP cloud and On-Premise systems
- Connectors for source, target, or proxy systems in your provisioning scenario
- Flexible data transformations, in which connectors can be customized using either the graphical editor or the JSON editor
- Automatic delivery of default provisioning systems for specific SAP Cloud solutions
- Real-time provisioning with dedicated source systems
- Consumable either directly through built-in APIs or from the user interface (UI), so the UI is integrated into the administration console in SAP Cloud Identity Services, together with the rest of its services
- SCIM-compliant integration with identity management solutions
- Ability to deal with cloud and on-premises user stores as sources, relying on dedicated integration with any local identity stores to ease adoption of the IAM reference architecture
- Comprehensive job scheduling for provisioning processes
- Fast and efficient administration of user onboarding
- Centralized end-to-end life cycle management of corporate identities in the Cloud
- Automated provisioning of existing On-Premise identities to Cloud applications
