The **SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI** uses the proven approach of the SAP Single Sign-On (SSO) application and provides users of the SAP GUI with simple and secure access to your SAP systems. It allows employees to log in only once to gain controlled access to specified ABAP-based applications with a single password. The solution enhances the user experience, increases end-user productivity, and protects business data with robust authentication methods.

- **Simple and secure access for SAP GUI Users:** The SAP Secure Login Service for SAP GUI supports X.509 certificates and Kerberos technology for secure authentication and SSO to your SAP systems. It does not require any additional on-premises server components.

- **X.509 certificates based on lean cloud service:** SSO capabilities can also be provided using short-lived X.509 certificates issued by the cloud services based on lean cloud service built atop the Identity Authentication service within SAP Cloud Identity Services. In that paradigm, the service harmonizes the authentication flow and user interface between the SAP GUI and the Web, and you can reuse all the capabilities of Identity Authentication, including integration with your existing identity provider infrastructure, such as Microsoft Entry ID or Okta products.

- **Advanced security capabilities:** By integrating with your existing identity provider solution, you can also benefit from its authentication capabilities - for example, strong multifactor or biometric authentication. The user experience for the initial authentication is the same, no matter which client you use to access your business application, which increases user acceptance and reduces complexity.![[Pasted image 20251008100000.png]]
