- Security is the **state of being protected** or safe from potential harm, danger, or threats.
- As an SAP System administrator, you are involved directly in providing and optimizing security processes using measures such as:
	- conducting regular audits
	- keeping the systems up to date
	- implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) to reduce the number of password resets
	- using digital signatures for the approval process

- **Availability:** Availability ensures that users can access their resources whenever needed. When determining your requirements regarding resource availability, you can consider the costs that result from unplanned downtime, such as customer loss, costs for unproductive employees, and overtime. Some damage, such as loss of reputation, cannot fully be factored in terms of money.

- **Authentication:** Authentication determines the real identity of the user. You can use the following authentication mechanisms in a system environment:
    - Authentication using user ID and password
    - Authentication using a smart card
    - Authentication using a smart card and PIN

- **Authorization:** Authorization defines the rights and privileges of the identified user and determines the functions a user can access. The application must be programmed to check if a user is authorized before accessing a particular function.


- **Confidentiality:** Confidentiality ensures the user’s history and communication are kept confidential. Information and services must be protected from unauthorized access. Authorizations to read, change, or add information or services must be granted explicitly to only a few users, and other users must be denied access. If you post something on the internet, the confidentiality of information is at risk.


- **Integrity:** Integrity ensures that user information transmitted or stored has not been altered. Programs and services can be executed successfully and provide accurate information. As a result, people, programs, or hardware components cannot modify programs and services.
- **Non repudiation:** Repudiation is the process of denying that you have done something, whereas non repudiation ensures that people cannot deny their actions.
