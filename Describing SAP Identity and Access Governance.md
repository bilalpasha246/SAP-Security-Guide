SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance is a leading platform that provides comprehensive security solutions for businesses. Designed to safeguard and streamline your operations, it is currently composed of five core components:

1. Access Analysis - conducts risk evaluations using predefined rules
2. Role Design - supports the creation and maintenance of business roles in your systems
3. Access Request - enables users to apply for access to applications in both On-Premise and cloud-based systems
4. Access Certification - reviews access
5. Privileged Access Management - logs consolidation and reviews with automated log assessment for fraud

The Access Analysis service is designed to provide real-time compliance analytics on risk and compliance-related activities. These services provide functionality similar to SAP Access Control but use a service delivery model. Key features and benefits:

- Delivers insight into segregation of duties (SoD) and critical access for On-Premise and cloud solutions.
- Built-in risk scoring.
- Provides configurable and predefined access policies and rules.
- Enables refinement of assignments to optimize user access for security and compliance.
- Allows management of controls, including integrated control monitoring and testing.
- Enables preconfigured audit reporting.

Access Analysis is a tool that checks how safe your organization's data is from different users or employees. You can use it at the level of the whole company or for individuals, and you can customize how it looks to make it easier to understand. It checks for risks using a specific set of rules. After running the test, it will show these risks, and then you can adjust who has access to what to limit them.

The total risk handling is shown in the Access Analysis Overview. For individuals, there's the User Access Analysis dashboard. Here, it shows the specific risks related to a particular user. It also tells you which risks have already happened and gives two scores to reflect how risky their access is.

The Access Compliance score tells you how many risks have not been handled for a particular user. On the other hand, the Access Effectiveness score tells you what access a user has and how they are using it. If a user has access to something but is not using it, this score decreases.

You can change user access within the User Access Analysis dashboard. For example, you can address any identified risks using the system's suggestions or remove access that is not necessary or appropriate. These changes are always recorded so that they can be checked later. All the required actions are then sent to the data-giving section. This means that the system makes it happen once you've decided what access a user can have.![[Pasted image 20251007132242.png]]

A core strength lies in its ability to link access analysis results to the role design process. This feature exhibits pertinent risk data within the Business Role definitions. This information can then be assessed, ensuring alignment with corporate policies and accommodating user access requirements.

Significantly, SAP has incorporated machine learning into its role design services. The application uses SAP Fiori-based tools to support bottom-up business role designs facilitated by advanced machine-learning algorithms. This union enhances the effectiveness of role reengineering processes, optimizing business role design, and functionality.![[Pasted image 20251007132430.png]]
The Access Request Service is an essential tool that allows users to request access to applications necessary for their work. This applies to both systems on the organization's network, known as 'On-Premise', and those based on the internet, known as 'cloud-based' systems.

To ensure transparency and security, each access request maintains a detailed audit log. This audit log thoroughly records all actions and processes related to each access request, an essential feature for administrative review and maintaining accountability.

The key features and benefits of the Access Request Service can be boiled down to the following points:

1. **Self-service access-request forms with built-in guides and data-driven filters:** The system is user-centric, focusing on ease-of-use and efficiency.
2. **Auditable access-request workflow:** The system allows for audit trails, enabling accountability and providing a reliable record of activities.
3. **Integrated, compliant user-provisioning process:** This refers to the system's compliance with standard protocols, maintaining the security and efficiency of granting and denying access.
4. **Integration with cloud apps:** The system is adaptable, fully functional, and efficient with applications located on the cloud. This provides comprehensive benefits for organizations employing cloud computing.

SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance's access certification service is a cutting-edge cloud-based solution to enhance your data and access control operations. Whether operating on a local server network ('On-Premise') or leveraging internet-based ('cloud') systems, this service is designed to manage and streamline the periodic assessments and confirmation of access rights to your business applications.

Privileged Access Management (PAM) is crucial in enforcing your company's standards for managing emergency access. It offers a practical approach to administering who is granted privileged or emergency access to your systems and applications.

- **Administration of privileged user accounts for On-Premise SAP Netweaver systems:** This feature underscores the PAM's capability to manage key user accounts within your company's local network systems.
- **Temporary use of elevated permissions:** PAM provides a mechanism for granting short-term access with elevated permissions, addressing emergency needs carefully without causing potential lasting security risks.
- **Integrated session tracking:** PAM records all user sessions, providing a clear audit trail that can be traced back for any necessary reviews or investigations.
- **Workflow-based activity review:** By aligning activity reviews with specific workflows, PAM enables a structured process for monitoring and managing access rights, enhancing efficiency and oversight.
- **Machine Learning (ML) based & Anomaly Detection:** PAM applies advanced ML algorithms to analyze user behavior and identify anomalies. This intelligence layer helps detect possible threats or breaches, ensuring robust security.
