Objective

After completing this lesson, you will be able to locate the User Management Tools.

## Starting the Database Administration Tools

In this lesson, you'll learn where to find the administration tools that can be used to perform the user management tasks. The SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) provides the following tools:

- SAP HANA Cloud Central with the integrated SAP HANA cockpit
- SAP HANA cockpit
- SAP HANA database explorer - SQL console

All three tools allow you to perform user management for SAP HANA Cloud.

### Opening SAP HANA Cloud Central

SAP HANA Cloud Central enables you to administer and monitor SAP HANA Cloud instances. You need to be assigned to the SAP HANA Cloud Administrator role collection to manage SAP HANA Cloud instances in SAP HANA Cloud Central. In your SAP BTP Cockpit, use the path _Global account_ → _Subaccount_ → _Services_ → _Instances and Subscriptions_ → _SAP HANA Cloud_ to open the SAP HANA Cloud Central application.

### Opening SAP HANA Database Explorer

As a user administrator, you often need to directly work with tables, schemata, and so on. For this, the SAP HANA Cloud database provides the SAP HANA database explorer.
