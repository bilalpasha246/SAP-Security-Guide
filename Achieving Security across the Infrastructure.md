An SAP system could work on different types of infrastructures:
- **On-Premise:** The components are physically located within an organization, typically in a company’s own data center. This setup provides organizations with total control over their systems/data, allowing them to customize the software to suit their business-specific needs. Furthermore, On-Premise infrastructure often operates under tighter security controls.

- **S/4 Cloud:** The computing resources are hosted in the cloud, typically by a third-party provider/host over the internet. There are two versions available:
    - Public Cloud edition–hosted on a public cloud infrastructure, which means the hardware and resources are shared with other organizations. It is managed and maintained by the cloud service provider, and the organization using it does not manage the underlying infrastructure.
    - Private Cloud edition–hosted on a private cloud infrastructure. This means that the hardware and resources are dedicated to a single organization, providing them with more control and customization options. The organization can choose to manage the infrastructure themselves or outsource it to a third-party service provider.

- **Hybrid:** an SAP infrastructure composed of On-Premise and cloud elements that combine the best of both worlds. This hybrid combination is achieved via the use of SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). SAP BTP is a suite of tools and services provided by SAP that helps businesses build, integrate, and extend applications in the cloud.

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, which are used by organizations to detect, analyze, and respond to security threat, help in real-time monitoring and reporting of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware
