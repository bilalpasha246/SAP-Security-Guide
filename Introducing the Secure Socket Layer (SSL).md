SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) in SAP is a protocol that establishes a secure and encrypted connection between a client and a server. It protects the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between the client (for example, a browser) and the server.

As SAP systems usually contain sensitive information that requires strong security measures, SSL is used to secure communication between the SAP system and external applications such as web browsers, mobile devices, and other third-party systems. Data being transferred between two parties (client and server) is encrypted, and the two parties can be authenticated.

SSL ensures that sensitive data, such as user credentials, payment information, and personal information, is securely transmitted over the network. If users must transfer their account information, SSL can authenticate them and encrypt the information exchanged during the transfer.

To implement SSL in SAP, the system administrator must configure the SAP system to use SSL certificates for authentication and encryption. This involves generating SSL certificates, configuring the SSL settings in the SAP system, and ensuring that the external applications connecting to the SAP system also support SSL.

You can use SSL for encryption to secure HTTP connections in SAP NetWeaver AS. SAP NetWeaver AS can act as the server or the client component of the HTTP connection in the following ways:

- Users are connecting to SAP NetWeaver AS using their Web browser
- SAP NetWeaver AS connecting to another SAP NetWeaver AS
- SAP NetWeaver AS connecting to another web server![[Pasted image 20251008075058.png]]
