SAP Cloud Identity Services are a group of services of SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP), which enable you to integrate identity and access management between systems. SAP Cloud Identity Services is the central solution for managing authentication, Single Sign-On (SSO), and the identity lifecycle. They improve system integration, provide a seamless user experience, and enhance security and compliance.

The SAP Cloud Identity Services consists of four services:
1. Identity Authentication
2. Identity Provisioning
3. Identity Directory
4. Authorization Management

The **Identity Authentication** service is responsible for the authentication and SSO.

In contrast, the **Identity Provisioning** service manages the identity lifecycle, including users and groups (create, change, delete, and so on).

The **Identity Directory** is the central place for storing and managing users and groups.

**Authorization Management** enables administrators to refine authorization policies that give access to resources in enabled SAP BTP-based business applications.
