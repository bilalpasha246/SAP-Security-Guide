One increasingly important aspect of the identity lifecycle is the use of personal data. The organization's privacy policy declares how users' private and personal information is processed. With consent management, users can confirm which personal information they allow the data processor to access, and use based on pre established conditions. Stronger, more uniform rules on data protection mean that citizens have more control over their personal data.
