Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to access multiple applications or services with just one set of login credentials. SAP SSO is a family of client-side and server-side components that enable Single Sign-On to SAP and non SAP products and applications across network domains.

The key benefits are as follows:

- **Increased User Productivity and Experience:** When a user logs in to a system that uses SSO, the system verifies the user's identity and then generates a token that contains the user's authentication information. Therefore, SSO improves the user experience by streamlining the login process and reducing users' time to enter their credentials.
- **Greater Security:** Use risk-based and multifactor authentication to implement robust security measures for your business-critical applications. The SSO system can use different authentication protocols such as SAML, OAuth, or OpenID Connect to securely transfer the authentication token between the identity provider and the applications or services the user tries to access. SSO eliminates the need for users to remember and manage multiple login credentials, which can improve security by reducing the likelihood of using weak or duplicate passwords.
- **Higher profits from increased cost efficiency:** Lowers helpdesk costs by significantly reducing the company’s number of calls for recovering passwords and unlocking accounts.

In a nutshell, SSO allows users to authenticate once and access multiple applications or services without logging in again, simplifying the user experience and improving security.
